## Git, GitHub

1. *What is your GitHub username?*
jxlee029

2. *What is the URL of your remote GitHub repo (created through Mr. Kennedy's exercises)?*
[jasonlee.github.io](https://github.com/jxlee029/git-workshop.git ()

## R

The command below will load the tidyverse package.  If you have installed R, RStudio, and the tidyverse package, it should display a list of loaded packages and their versions.


## R Markdown 

1. *Create a bulleted list with at least 3 items*
* Programming
* Geography
* Engineering
2. *Write a single paragraph that demonstrates the use of italics, bold, bold italics, code, and includes a link. The paragraph does not have to make sense.*
This is the website for ***“R for Data Science”***. This book will teach you how to do **data science** with R: You’ll learn how to get your data into R, get it into the most useful structure, transform it, visualise it and model it. In this book, you will find a practicum of skills for data science. Just as a chemist learns how to clean test tubes and stock a lab, you’ll learn how to clean data and draw plots—and many other things besides. *These are the skills that allow data science to happen, and here you will find the best practices for doing each of these things with R.* You’ll learn how to use the grammar of graphics, literate programming, and reproducible research to save time. You’ll also learn how to manage cognitive resources to `facilitate discoveries` when wrangling, visualising, and exploring data.
3. *Create a level 3 heading*

### Hello world!!!


## R 
Run ggplot(data = mpg). What do you see?
An empty graph
How many rows are in mpg? How many columns?
In the initial plot there is no row or columns visible
What does the drv variable describe? Read the help for ?mpg to find out.
It denotes the drive train of the vehicle
Make a scatterplot of hwy vs cyl.
[plot_hwy_vs-cyl_png in gitworkshop](https://github.com/jxlee029/git-workshop/raw/main/plot_hwy_vs-cyl_png)
What happens if you make a scatterplot of class vs drv? Why is the plot not useful?
It is the class of the vehicle vs the drive train type of the vehicle. the plot would graph the variations between the two keys.

#### Data Visualization Exercises

1. (Q2) *How many rows are in mpg? How many columns?*
In the initial plot there is no row or columns visible
1. (Q4) *Make a scatterplot of hwy vs cyl.*
![here is a picture of the plot](https://github.com/jxlee029/git-workshop/raw/main/plot_hwy_vs-cyl_png)

#### Workflow: basics Exercises

1. (Q2) *Tweak each of the following R commands so that they run correctly (`library(tidyverse)` is correct):*

```r
library(tidyverse)
ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

filter(mpg, cyl == 8)

filter(diamonds, carat > 3)
```

## Google Colab

1. *What are the URLs of your Google Colab notebooks (both Python and R)?*
https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fBcM78k-XKN-CFtlOwxH7FMVyR6dPM5w?usp=sharing
## Tableau

*Insert your the image of your final bar chart here*
![here is a picture of the Sales in the Eastern Region](https://github.com/jxlee029/git-workshop/raw/main/SalesintheEast.png)
1. *What conclusions can you draw from the chart?*
Tables and bookcases do not seem to be profitable in the east even if they have high sales. Chairs seem to do well. 
## Observable and Vega-Lite

### A Taste of Observable

1. *In the "New York City weather forecast" section, try replacing `Forecast: detailedForecast` with `Forecast: shortForecast`. Then press the blue play button  or use Shift-Return to run your change. What happens?*
The forecast text becomes the short version; this removes the wind direction and speed/ precipitation and percentage. this could be useful for mobile apps.

1. *Under the scatterplot of temperature vs. name, try replacing `markCircle()` with `markSquare()`. Then press the blue play button  or use Shift-Return to run your change. What happens? How about `markPoint()`?*
It changes the symbol for the graphed point to a square and then a point.

1. *Under "Pick a location, see the weather forecast", pick a location on the map.  Where was the point you picked near?*
I picked a point near Chesapeake, VA. the result showed Portsmouth VA. which is close.
1. *The last visualization on this page is a "fancy" weather chart embedded from another notebook.  Click on the 3 dots next to that chart and choose 'Download PNG'.  Insert the PNG into your report.*
![here is a picture of the Fancy Weather Chart](https://github.com/jxlee029/git-workshop/raw/main/weatherChart.png)
### Charting with Vega-Lite

`markCircle()`

1. *Pass an option of `{ size: 200 }` to `markCircle()`.*
The size of the circle increases
1. *Try `markSquare` instead of `markCircle`.*
Changes the circle to a square
1. *Try `markPoint({ shape: 'diamond' })`.*
Changes shape to a hollow diamond, and it shrinks because I erase the size: 200 parameter.

`vl.x().fieldQ("Horsepower")`, ...

1. *Change `Horsepower` to `Acceleration`*
The acceleration field is in the X axis of the graph. Acceleration does not seem to have a direct relationship with horsepower in terms of MPG.
1. *Swap what fields are displayed on the x- and y-axis*
It inverses the table showing the acceleration as the y axis and miles per gallon as the x axis.
`vl.tooltip().fieldN("Name")`

1. *Change `Name` to `Origin`.*
Changed the tooltip to the country of origin. Previously it was the name of the vehicle

Another example, `count()`

1. *Remove the `vl.y().fieldN("Origin")` line.*
Removing the line removes the classification so it now shows the total count of records.
1. *Replace `count()` with `average("Miles_per_Gallon")`.*
Changed the x axis to miles per gallon. Initially with three countries and then with all records.
